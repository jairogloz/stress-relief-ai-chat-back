# 🌟 Stress Relief AI Chat Backend

## 🧠 Purpose

The **Stress Relief AI Chat** is a specialized backend service designed to support a chat application with a single, powerful goal: **to make you feel better no matter what**. Unlike a general-purpose AI chat, this app is laser-focused on providing comfort, actionable advice, and a sense of calm in every interaction.

### 🎯 What Makes It Different?

- **Always Positive:** Every response is crafted to uplift and reassure.
- **Action-Oriented:** Not just words—every chat session includes **specific, actionable steps** you can take to improve your situation or your mood.
- **Real-Time AI Responses:** The app currently connects with **OpenAI's GPT-4**, with plans to integrate **additional AI models** in the future to ensure diverse and tailored responses.

## 🛠️ How It Works

The backend serves as a bridge between the frontend chat interface and various AI assistants. It manages user authentication through **Supabase** (currently under development) and handles AI interactions using the **github.com/sashabaranov/go-openai** library. The application follows a **Hexagonal Architecture** to ensure clean code and maintainability.

### 🔍 Key Features

1. **User Authentication (Under Development):** The app will use **Supabase** for easy signup and login.
2. **AI Chat Endpoint:** Seamless integration with the frontend to process user inputs and generate AI responses.
3. **Real-Time Support:** Currently connects directly to **OpenAI GPT-4** and aims to support additional AI models.
4. **No Chat Storage:** Ensures privacy by acting only as a bridge—no personal data or chat history is stored.
